# Spring Boot Modulith Demo
This repository contains the code for the Spring Modulith.

### What is Spring Boot Modulith
Spring Boot Modulith is a framework designed to support the development of modular monolithic applications in Spring Boot. It helps in structuring applications into distinct, modular parts while keeping them within a single deployable unit, hence maintaining the simplicity of monolithic deployments. This approach allows for better organization, maintainability, and potential future extraction of modules into microservices if needed.

### Key Features of Spring Boot Modulith

1. **Modular Structure**:
   - Encourages breaking down the application into modules with clear boundaries.
   - Modules can be developed and tested independently within the same application.

2. **Explicit Dependencies**:
   - Facilitates explicit definition of dependencies between modules.
   - Helps in understanding and managing the interactions between different parts of the application.

3. **Isolation and Encapsulation**:
   - Promotes encapsulation of logic within modules.
   - Reduces coupling between modules, making the application easier to maintain and evolve.

4. **Testing Support**:
   - Provides tools and guidelines for writing tests at the module level.
   - Supports both unit and integration testing of modules.

5. **Transition to Microservices**:
   - Modular monolithic design can serve as a stepping stone to microservices.
   - Modules can be extracted as independent services when needed.

### Benefits

- **Improved Maintainability**: Modular structure makes it easier to understand, maintain, and evolve the codebase.
- **Scalability**: While starting as a monolith, the modular design allows for easier scaling by splitting modules into microservices when required.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Helps in organizing the codebase by separating different functionalities into distinct modules.

### Example Usage

Here’s a brief overview of how you might structure a Spring Boot application using the Modulith approach:

1. **Define Modules**: Organize your codebase into packages or modules, each representing a distinct part of the application (e.g., `user`, `order`, `inventory`).

2. **Set Up Dependencies**: Use Spring's dependency injection to manage dependencies between modules.

3. **Encapsulate Logic**: Ensure that each module encapsulates its logic and exposes only necessary functionality to other modules.

4. **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for each module to ensure that they function correctly in isolation and when integrated.

### Example Project Structure

```plaintext
src/main/java/com/example
├── Application.java
├── catalog
│   ├── web -> controllers -> ProductController.java
│   ├── domain -> ProductEntity.java / ProductServiceImpl.java
│   ├── config -> CatalogExceptionHandler.java
│   └── ...
├── order
│   ├── web -> controllers -> OrderController.java
│   ├── domain -> OrderEntity.java / OrderServiceImpl.java
│   ├── config -> OrderExceptionHandler.java
│   └── ...
└── inventory
    ├── web -> controllers -> InventoryController.java
    ├── domain -> InventoryEntity.java / InventoryServiceImpl.java
    ├── config -> InventoryExceptionHandler.java
    └── ...
```

### Example Configuration

1. **Application.java**: Main class to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

2. **Catalog Module**: Example of a catalog service within the `catalog` module.

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {
    public String getProductDetails(String userId) {
        // Business logic for fetching user details
    }
}
```

3. **Order Module**: Example of an order service within the `order` module.

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    public String createOrder(String userId, String productId) {
        String userDetails = userService.getUserDetails(userId);
        // Business logic for creating an order
    }
}
```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components within each module.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between modules to ensure they work together as expected.

### Summary

Spring Boot Modulith is a powerful framework that allows developers to build modular monolithic applications, providing a structured approach to organize code and manage dependencies. It offers a balance between the simplicity of monolithic applications and the organization and maintainability benefits of modular design, while also enabling a smooth transition to microservices if needed.
